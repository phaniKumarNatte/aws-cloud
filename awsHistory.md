What is computing?
Computing is the act of using machines (computers) and programs to take information in, change or analyze it, store it, and give useful results out. That sounds simple, but computing powers nearly everything digital you use: phones, websites, bank systems, smart cars, and cloud services.

1) The simple idea (a one-line definition)

Computing = input → process → output + storage, where a machine follows rules (a program) to turn raw information into something useful.
💡 Real-World Examples

ATM Machine : 
Input: You insert card and PIN
Process: Bank server checks balance
Storage: Data stored in bank’s database
Output: You get cash or balance info

What is aws ? 
AWS = Rent-a-Computer + Rent-a-Database + Rent-a-Storage + Rent-anything-you-need-over-the-internet.
You pay only for what you use, and you can build anything from a small app to a global company without owning a single physical server.

History Of AWS : 
🏁 1. Before AWS (The Problem)
Let’s go back to early 2000s.
Amazon (the e-commerce company) was growing very fast — millions of people were shopping online.
Amazon realized something:
“Every time we build a new project, we spend too much time setting up servers, databases, and storage before even writing business logic.”
Example:
If a new Amazon team wanted to build a feature like “Product Recommendations”, they first had to:
Buy physical servers 🖥️
Install operating systems ⚙️
Configure databases 💾
Manage network and scaling 🌐
That setup could take months — and most of that infrastructure work was repeated again and again for every project.
So Amazon engineers thought:
“What if we create a common platform that provides these things (servers, storage, databases) on demand — so teams can start building immediately?”
That idea became the foundation of AWS.

🚀 2. AWS Was Born (2003–2006)
🔹 2003–2004 — The Idea

Amazon decided to expose its internal tools and infrastructure as services — so developers could “rent” them through the internet instead of buying hardware.

They called it Amazon Web Services (AWS) — a set of cloud-based building blocks for developers.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
🔹 2006 — Official Launch

In March 2006, AWS officially launched its first two big services:

**2006 - S3 (Simple Storage Service):**  
Used to store files on the internet — like Google Drive for developers.  
👉 Example: A photo-sharing app can store user photos on S3 instead of buying storage drives.

**2006 - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**  
Used to rent virtual servers on demand.  
👉 Example: A startup can launch a server in 2 minutes instead of waiting weeks for physical setup.

These two services were revolutionary — you could:
Start small and pay only for what you use 💰
Scale up when traffic increases 📈
Avoid maintaining hardware 🛠️

🏗️ 3. Expansion (2007–2012)

AWS quickly became popular among startups — because it saved time and money.

Popular examples:

Netflix moved to AWS around 2009 after its data centers failed.
Now, all movies you stream are hosted using AWS servers.

Airbnb built its early platform on AWS to handle unpredictable user growth.

NASA used AWS to store and share large space images publicly.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AWS Added Many New Services:

| Service                           | Year | What It Does                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| RDS (Relational Database Service) | 2009 | Managed databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL               |
| CloudFront                        | 2008 | Fast content delivery (like CDN for websites)            |
| Elastic Beanstalk                 | 2011 | Automatically deploy and manage apps                     |
| Lambda                            | 2014 | Serverless computing — run code without managing servers |


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
🌎 4. AWS Goes Global (2013–2018)

AWS started building data centers (regions) across the world — North America, Europe, Asia, etc.
Each region had Availability Zones — multiple data centers for high reliability.
Example:
If you’re in India, AWS Mumbai region lets your app load faster for Indian users.
If one server fails, another automatically takes over — so no downtime.

By now, AWS wasn’t just for startups.
Big companies like Coca-Cola, Samsung, and BMW also started migrating to AWS.

💥 5. Dominating the Cloud Market (2018–Present)

By late 2010s, AWS became the leader in cloud computing, ahead of:
Microsoft Azure ☁️
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) ☁️
Now AWS provides 200+ services, including:
Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
Storage (S3, Glacier)
Compute (EC2, Lambda)
Networking (VPC, CloudFront)
AI/ML (SageMaker)
IoT, Analytics, and more

🧠 6. Real-Time Example (How AWS Changed the Game)

Let’s compare Before AWS vs After AWS for a startup idea 👇

💡 You have an idea for a food delivery app
   • Before AWS: ₹10–20 lakh for hardware, office space & engineers to manage servers.
   • After AWS : Launch EC2 & S3 — costs only ₹1000–₹2000/month.
   
⚙️ Setup Time
   • Before AWS: Weeks or months
   • After AWS : Just a few minutes

📈 Scaling
   • Before AWS: Buy and configure new servers manually
   • After AWS : Auto-scaling or resize instance instantly

💰 Cost
   • Before AWS: Pay huge upfront setup costs
   • After AWS : Pay-as-you-go (only for what you use)

🏆 7. Today’s Status (2025)

AWS is:

The largest cloud provider globally (over 30% of market share)
Used by millions of companies
Present in 30+ geographic regions
Powering AI, big data, IoT, and blockchain projects
Example:
Hotstar uses AWS to stream live cricket matches to millions of users.
BYJU’S uses AWS to handle student data and live classes.
Tesla uses AWS for its self-driving car data storage.
