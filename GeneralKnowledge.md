🔐 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
Multi-Factor Authentication means using two or more steps to prove that you are really you when you log in.
It’s an extra layer of security beyond your password.

🧩 Simple Example:
Imagine you’re trying to unlock your bank account online:
You enter your password 🧠 → (something you know)
Then you receive a one-time code (OTP) on your phone 📱 → (something you have)
✅ You need both to log in.
Even if a hacker knows your password, they can’t log in without your phone.

🧠 In Simple Words:
MFA = Password + One More Proof
(like OTP, fingerprint, or authentication app code)
